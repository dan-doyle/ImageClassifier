# AI Programming with Python Project

### Overview
Project code for Udacity's [AI Programming with Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089) Nanodegree program. In this project, we first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch in a Jupyter notebook, then convert it into a command line application. 

### Dataset
We use a [102 category flower dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) with each category representing a different category of flower found commonly in the United Kingdom.
